LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) is a standard developed by IMS Global Learning Consortium to allow integration between learning management systems (LMS) and external tools or content. It enables different systems to communicate and share resources seamlessly, providing a standardized way for tools and platforms to interact.

## LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability)

- **Purpose**: Facilitates the integration of external educational applications and content with LMSs.
- **Components**:
  - **Tool Providers**: External tools or content that provide educational resources or activities.
  - **Tool Consumers**: LMSs that use these external tools or content.
- **Features**:
  - Secure data exchange between LMSs and external tools.
  - Single sign-on (SSO) capabilities for users.
  - Standardized way to launch tools and pass context information (e.g., user role, course context).

## Basic LTI (bLTI)

- **Introduction**: An earlier version or subset of LTI, focusing on the core functionality needed to launch external tools from an LMS.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Launch Mechanism**: Defines how external tools are launched from the LMS.
  - **Basic Data Exchange**: Includes information such as user identity, role, and course context.
  - **Simplified Security**: Uses OAuth for secure communication.
- **Usage**: Suitable for simple tool integrations without the need for advanced features provided by later versions of LTI.

### Differences between LTI and Basic LTI

1. **Scope**:
   - **LTI**: Broader scope with more advanced features like richer data exchange, service endpoints, and deeper integration capabilities.
   - **bLTI**: Focuses on the essential components needed to launch tools.

2. **Features**:
   - **LTI**: Includes features for grading, advanced user data, and extended services.
   - **bLTI**: Limited to basic launch and essential data sharing.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - **LTI**: Suitable for complex integrations requiring detailed data exchange and additional services.
   - **bLTI**: Adequate for simple integrations where basic launch functionality is sufficient. 

LTI has evolved significantly, and later versions (like LTI 1.3) offer enhanced security, richer data models, and improved interoperability compared to the basic LTI specification.

We can integrate Canvas with a Liferay portlet. Liferay is an open-source portal framework that allows for the integration of various applications and services through its portlets. Integrating Canvas with Liferay can be achieved using LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) standards. Here’s how you can approach this integration:

### Steps to Integrate Canvas with Liferay Portlet

1. **Prepare Canvas as an LTI Tool Provider**:
   - Ensure that your Canvas instance supports LTI.
   - Obtain the necessary LTI credentials (Consumer Key and Shared Secret) from Canvas. This can be done by configuring the external app in the Canvas settings.

2. **Create an LTI Tool in Canvas**:
   - Navigate to the Canvas Admin settings.
   - Add a new LTI tool by providing the necessary details such as the launch URL, consumer key, and shared secret.

3. **Set Up Liferay as an LTI Consumer**:
   - **Liferay Configuration**: Configure a portlet in Liferay to act as an LTI consumer.
   - **Create the Portlet**: Develop a custom Liferay portlet that can send LTI requests and handle responses. You can use Java for this purpose.

4. **Implement LTI Launch in Liferay Portlet**:
   - **LTI Launch Request**: Your Liferay portlet should create an LTI launch request and redirect the user to the Canvas LTI tool.
   - **OAuth Signing**: Sign the LTI request using OAuth. Libraries like Apache Oltu can be used to handle OAuth in Java.
   - **User Context**: Ensure that the necessary user context (like user ID, role, and course information) is passed along with the LTI request.

5. **Handle LTI Responses in Liferay**:
   - **LTI Launch URL**: Canvas will respond with an LTI launch URL that needs to be handled by the Liferay portlet.
   - **Render Content**: Once the LTI tool launches, render the Canvas content within the Liferay portlet.

### Example Code for Liferay Portlet

Here is a basic example of how you might set up an LTI launch request in a Liferay portlet:

```java
import javax.portlet.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CanvasLtiPortlet extends GenericPortlet {

    private static final String CONSUMER_KEY = "your_consumer_key";
    private static final String SHARED_SECRET = "your_shared_secret";
    private static final String CANVAS_LTI_URL = "https://yourcanvasinstance.com/lti/launch";

    @Override
    protected void doView(RenderRequest request, RenderResponse response) throws PortletException, IOException {
        PortletRequestDispatcher dispatcher = getPortletContext().getRequestDispatcher("/view.jsp");
        dispatcher.include(request, response);
    }

    @Override
    public void processAction(ActionRequest request, ActionResponse response) throws PortletException, IOException {
        Map<String, String> ltiParams = new HashMap<>();
        ltiParams.put("oauth_consumer_key", CONSUMER_KEY);
        ltiParams.put("resource_link_id", "your_resource_link_id");
        ltiParams.put("user_id", "current_user_id");
        ltiParams.put("roles", "Learner");

        // Add other LTI parameters as needed

        // Sign the LTI request using OAuth
        String signedLtiUrl = signLtiRequest(CANVAS_LTI_URL, ltiParams, SHARED_SECRET);

        // Redirect to Canvas LTI tool
        response.sendRedirect(signedLtiUrl);
    }

    private String signLtiRequest(String url, Map<String, String> params, String secret) {
        // Implement OAuth signing logic here
        // You can use libraries like Apache Oltu to handle OAuth signing
        return url + "?" + params.toString();
    }
}
```

### Deployment and Testing

1. **Deploy the Portlet**: Package and deploy your Liferay portlet to your Liferay instance.
2. **Test Integration**: Add the portlet to a Liferay page and test the LTI launch to ensure that it correctly redirects to Canvas and loads the desired content.

### Benefits of Integration

- **Unified Experience**: Users can access Canvas content directly from within the Liferay portal, providing a seamless experience.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users can benefit from SSO capabilities, reducing the need for multiple logins.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Leveraging LTI, you can integrate various educational tools and content into your Liferay portal.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Canvas with your Liferay portlet, enhancing the capabilities of your Liferay-based platform with the powerful features of Canvas.
